<p> This page specifies who worked on which parts of the project. Naturally everyone contributed to all pages of the website, whether by editing or helping to write/flow of ideas, assisting with coding, providing photos, information, reflections or projecs to embed, however this page outlines which page each person had as their major focus. In other words, who did the most work on each page.
