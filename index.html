<p class="textcenter">What I enjoyed about Intoduction to Coding is that I can be in charge of what I am making. Doing the NCSS challenge helped me improve my problem solving and coding skills. One thing I would improve in the subject though is to have more time learning about HTML and CSS because we didn't spend that much time on it and that meant that we didn't learn as much as we could have.</p>

<p class="textcenter">Hello, my name is Max and I am going to talk about Introduction to Coding. What I love about Intro to Coding is that I can take charge of what my coding does, this is extremely evident in the Python coding language. You can do just about anything with this language. With Python, you can make games such as adventure games, or you could use it as a calculator. There is a website called Grok where you can learn about many different coding languages and their functions, this is what I really enjoyed about coding, learning about the many things that can be done with computers. What I didnâ€™t like about the subject was that I felt like the class was being told too much about functions that can be done with coding. It would be more rewarding if we were left to figure out how to get a take done ourselves, but of course we should get a little bit of help. I would like this aspect of Introduction to Coding to be changed. I would want to improve on learning Python and HTML like the back of my hand and seeing what I can accomplish.</p>

<p class="textcenter">I enjoy coding because I am learning new concepts and the concepts have real-world applications as well. I felt that I was good at understanding the concepts that we were being taught during the lessons. However, I sometime felt that the learning was quite tedious, and it was sometimes very easy to be disengaged. One thing that I would like to improve on is my ability in HTML as I found it confusing at times and I would like to improve at it</p>
